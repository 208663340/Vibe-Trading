"""Regression: HostThrottle must not leak memory from stale bucket entries.

The ``_last`` dict grows one entry per unique host bucket and never
evicts stale entries. A batch job that queries many distinct hosts
(e.g. N tickers across N providers) accumulates dead entries without
bound. The fix adds a periodic sweep that drops buckets whose spacing
window (fire_at + min_interval) has fully elapsed.

The sweep must be interval-aware: a bucket that fired 0.1s ago with a
1.5s interval is still within its spacing window and must NOT be swept.
Sweeping it early would let the next request fire immediately with no
spacing, defeating the rate limiter.
