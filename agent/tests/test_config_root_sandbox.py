"""Regression tests for the sandboxed runtime root (issue #1116).

The suite must never resolve its config root against the real home directory.
It used to: tests isolated themselves by monkeypatching ``HOME``, which
``Path.home()`` ignores on Windows in favour of ``%USERPROFILE%``, so on Windows
the redirect was inert and runs appended fabricated ``order_rejected`` records to
the real, tamper-evident live audit ledger. ``conftest.py`` now redirects home at
import time — before collection, so constants baked at module import resolve
there too — and these tests pin that contract.

The sandbox controls ``Path.home()`` only, and deliberately DELETES
``VIBE_TRADING_HOME`` rather than setting it, so a single knob decides the root
and per-test home redirection still wins. Both halves are asserted below.
