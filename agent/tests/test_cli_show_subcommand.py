"""Regression tests for the ``show`` subcommand dispatch.

The subcommand parser defines a positional ``run_id``, but the dispatch
previously read the ``--show`` flag instead — so ``vibe-trading show <id>``
always crashed with ``TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /:
'PosixPath' and 'NoneType'``. The flag form kept working, hiding the bug.
